# Parkinson-Detection
A machine learning project trying to detect if a person has parkinson or not based on data. The model is based on data from the Parkinson dataset and uses the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm for training and prediction. The code reads the data from the CSV file and selects the appropriate columns as features for the model and the "status" column as the category we want to predict. The code also uses the train_test_split command to split the data into training and testing sets. Then, it trains the model, calculates its accuracy on the training and testing data, and makes a prediction for the category of a new dataset to determine whether the patient has the disease or not.
